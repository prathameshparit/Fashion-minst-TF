# Fashion-MNIST Classification Model (Collaborative Notebook)
This repository contains a collaborative Jupyter notebook showcasing a classification model for the Fashion-MNIST dataset.

## About the Fashion-MNIST dataset
Fashion-MNIST is a dataset of 70,000 grayscale images of 10 fashion categories, commonly used as a benchmark for machine learning algorithms. Each image has a size of 28x28 pixels.

The 10 categories in the Fashion-MNIST dataset are:

* T-shirt/top
* Trouser
* Pullover
* Dress
* Coat
* Sandal
* Shirt
* Sneaker
* Bag
* Ankle boot
## About the notebook
The Jupyter notebook in this repository includes code snippets and visualizations demonstrating data preparation, model creation, and evaluation for the Fashion-MNIST dataset.
